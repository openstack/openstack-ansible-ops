# Processors are used to reduce the number of fields in the exported event or to
# enhance the event with external metadata. This section defines a list of
# processors that are applied one by one and the first one receives the initial
# event:
#
#   event -> filter1 -> event1 -> filter2 ->event2 ...
#
# The supported processors are drop_fields, drop_event, include_fields,
# decode_json_fields, and add_cloud_metadata.
#
# For example, you can use the following processors to keep the fields that
# contain CPU load percentages, but remove the fields that contain CPU ticks
# values:
#
#processors:
#  - include_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu"]
#  - drop_fields:
#      fields: ["cpu.user", "cpu.system"]
#
# The following example drops the events that have the HTTP response code 200:
#
#processors:
#  - drop_event:
#      when:
#        equals:
#          http.code: 200
#
# The following example renames the field a to b:
#
#processors:
#  - rename:
#      fields:
#        - from: "a"
#          to: "b"

# The following example tokenizes the string into fields:
#

#  - dissect:
#      tokenizer: "%{key1} - %{key2}"
#      field: "message"
#      target_prefix: "dissect"

# provider about the host machine. It works on EC2, GCE, DigitalOcean,
# Tencent Cloud, and Alibaba Cloud.
#
#processors:
#  - add_cloud_metadata: ~
#
# The following example enriches each event with the machine's local time zone
# offset from UTC.
#
#processors:
#  - add_locale:
#      format: offset
#
# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# given fields to an existing container id and adds info from that container:

# The following example enriches each event with docker metadata, it matches
# container id from log path available in `source` field (by default it expects
# it to be /var/lib/docker/containers/*/*.log).
#
#processors:
#  - add_docker_metadata: ~

# The following example enriches each event with host metadata.
#
#processors:

# The following example enriches each event with process metadata using
# process IDs included in the event.
#
#processors:
#  - add_process_metadata:
#      match_pids: ["system.process.ppid"]
#      target: system.process.parent
#
# The following example decodes fields containing JSON strings
# and replaces the strings with valid JSON objects.

#      from: "field1"
#      to: "field2"

#      max_bytes: 1024
